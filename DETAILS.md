# Details

We have two Javascript files `app.js` and `utils.js`:

- `app.js` starts the application.

- `utils.js` handles the data fetching, how the data is render in a table, and the pagination logic.

# How does this work

You can skip this step if you have `npx` installed on your machine. If not

- Install `npx` globally on your machine with `npm install -g npx`, you can confirm if it is successfully installed with `which npx` to see the path or simply use `npx --version` to confirm the version installed.

- Run `npx serve`

- Copy the local address and paste it in your browser i.e. `http://localhost:3000`

- On load, you should see the `page 1` data, and you can click on `Next` to see the `page 2` and so on.

Another Option is to open `index.html` file, right click, and select "Open with Live Server"
